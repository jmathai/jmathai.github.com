  <p>
  I'm interested in the <em><a href="https://careers.circle.com/us/en/job/CIICIRUSJR100137EXTERNALENUS/Principal-Product-Manager">Principal Product Manager</a></em> role at <em>Circle</em>.
    I created this page to convince both you and me that joining the Circle team would be mutually beneficial.

  <h2>I'm Genuinely Interested</h2>
  <p>
    I believe that blockchain and cryptocurrency are important innovations which have the ability to catapult commerce forward.
    It doesn't take much to see that traditional banking is a bottleneck for innovation and the possibilities of unblocking that is very exciting.
  </p>
  <p>
  I enjoy understanding the underlying framework of blockchain technologies and <a href="https://jaisenmathai.com/articles/life-of-a-blockchain-transaction-proof-of-work/">sharing them in easy to understand ways to others</a>.

  <h2>I Have Designed APIs</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>API Design:</strong> I was the product manager of the Google Workspace AdminSDK APIs. 
    In this role, I worked directly with internal partner teams and external customers who were building applications on these APIs.
    This involved evolving legacy APIs and resources for modern use cases.
    I worked closely with the internal AIP teams to identify how to best apply the AIPs to corner cases.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, I advocated for and helped the team design long running APIs (<a href="https://google.aip.dev/151">AIP-151</a>) in a way where 80% of uses cases did not have to poll for the status of an operation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another example I'm quite fond of is a dynamic photo generation API I designed at my startup Trovebox.
    The API let users <a href="https://github.com/photo/frontend/blob/master/documentation/faq/PhotoGeneration.markdown">generate any sized thumbnail of their photos</a> and would cache the generated photo for future requests.
    This design enabled faster iteration of both our first party applications as well as third party.

  <h2>I Have Strong Product Sense</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Product Management, Google (7 years):</strong> I was a product manager and product lead at Google for 7 years. I started as an early member of the team which launched Cloud Identity and went on to lead the Cloud Functions product where I helped launch Cloud Functions (2nd gen) and moved the product into Gartner's leader quadrant for the first time.

    <strong>Founder, Trovebox (4 years):</strong> I co-founded Trovebox wearing many hats ranging from developer, marketer and fund raiser. The most valuable part of my experience was building a strong community around our open source product. The community consisted of thousands of individuals and hundreds of contributors. I was on the front line of user feedback and translated their feedback into scalable product capabilities.
