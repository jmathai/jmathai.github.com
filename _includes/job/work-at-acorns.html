  <h2>I'm Genuinely Interested</h2>
  <p>
    I care about creating useful things and find the better I know the user the more I succeed.
    Improving financial literacy and simplifying smart investing are both areas I have experience in.

  <h2>I Understand the User</h2>

    <strong>Budget Coach at Vineyard Cincinnati:</strong> I volunteer as a budget coach at Vineyard Cincinnati talking with individuals and couples facing financial stress.
    In this role, I listen more than I talk.
    Finances are deeply personal and I understand it can take lots of courage for people to seek financial advice.
    I help people understand their income and expenses and work with them to create a budget.
    Success as a budget coach means lowering stress &amp; chaos while increasing peace &amp; motivation.
    Getting finances in order can drastically change people's lives and that's why I do this.

  <strong>Creator of FIers:</strong> I created tools to help people reach financial independence. The tools include a <a href="https://fiers.jmathai.com/features">retirement planner</a> and <a href="https://fiers.jmathai.com/features/spend">envelope budgeting app</a>. The retirement planner forecasts how someone would draw down from their nest egg during retirement and simulated how well it would fare using historic market data. FIers was my way of sharing what I learned over many years researching and planning my family's own financial goals and it's helped thousands of people do the same.

  <h2>I Have Strong Product Sense</h2>

    <strong>Product Management, Google (7 years):</strong> I was a product manager and product lead at Google for 7 years. I started as an early member of the team which launched Cloud Identity and went on to lead the Cloud Functions product where I helped launch Cloud Functions (2nd gen) and moved the product into Gartner's leader quadrant for the first time.

    <strong>Founder, Trovebox (4 years):</strong> I co-founded Trovebox wearing many hats ranging from developer, marketer and fund raiser. The most valuable part of my experience was building a strong community around our open source product. The community consisted of thousands of individuals and hundreds of contributors. I was on the front line of user feedback and translated their feedback into scalable product capabilities.
