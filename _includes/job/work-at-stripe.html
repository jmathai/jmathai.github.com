  <p>Hello.</p>
  <p>
    I'm interested in the <em><a href="https://stripe.com/jobs/listing/product-manager-sail/6372464">Product Manager, Sail</a></em> role at <em>Stripe</em>.
    I created this page to convince both you and me that joining the Stripe team would be mutually beneficial.

  <h2>I'm Genuinely Interested</h2>
  <p>
    I have been a Stripe customer for over a decade and appreciate the company's attention to detail.
    Having originally integrated with legacy payment providers and banks, Stripe's value proposition was clear the moment I heard it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Being rooted in user experience, Sail hits a sweet spot that I find exciting: technical challenges, user experience and customer value.

  <h2>I Understand User Experience</h2>
  <p>
    I believe user experience resides in the sum of every small detail.
    How can you help users accomplish complex goals as simply as possible while eliminating surprises?
    Accepting credit card payments seems straightforward at first glance.
    Simply have the necessary form fields and a submit button.
    But a great payment experience needs to handle a multitude of challenges.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, it's likely that a user will mistype their credit card number.
    Are there ways to make it easier and less error prone for someone to transcribe 16 numbers from a card to their keyboard?
    There's many variants of this and solving them elegantly takes deep thinking and understanding of real world user interactions.
    I appreciate that Stripe has basically set the gold standard here and I'm excited at the opportunity to help.
  </p>
  <p>
    Part of this article is to convince you that I do indeed think this way.
    Here is an oldie but goodie.
    At an earlier startup, we wanted to <a href="https://medium.com/@jmathai/ux-nirvana-elegant-pagination-with-infinite-scrolling-636c0ae6e3b1">make it easy for users to browse photo collections consisting of thousands of photos</a>.
    We felt that infinite scrolling would be an improvement over the traditional paginated experience we were using.
    However, we did not want to lose the ability to deep link into a photo collection or break the functionality of the browser's back button.
    This took a lot of thinking and ultimately inventing a new experience we had never seen in the wild.

  <h2>I Understand Developer Experience</h2>
  <p>
    I was the product manager of the Google Workspace AdminSDK APIs. 
    In this role, I worked directly with internal partner teams and external customers who were building applications on these APIs.
    This involved evolving legacy APIs and resources for modern use cases.
    I worked closely with the internal AIP teams to identify how to best apply the AIPs to corner cases.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, I advocated for and helped the team design long running APIs (<a href="https://google.aip.dev/151">AIP-151</a>) in a way where 80% of uses cases did not have to poll for the status of an operation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another example I'm quite fond of is a dynamic photo generation API I designed at my startup Trovebox.
    The API let users <a href="https://github.com/photo/frontend/blob/master/documentation/faq/PhotoGeneration.markdown">generate any sized thumbnail of their photos</a> and would cache the generated photo for future requests.
    This design enabled faster iteration of both our first party applications as well as third party.

  <h2>I Have Strong Product Sense</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Product Management, Google (7 years):</strong> I was a product manager and product lead at Google for 7 years. I started as an early member of the team which launched Cloud Identity and went on to lead the Cloud Functions product within the Serverless organization. Before leaving Google, I was the Gemini (GenAI) lead for Serverless where I got to launch several first of a kind experiences to users.

  <p>
    <strong>Founder, Trovebox (4 years):</strong> I co-founded Trovebox wearing many hats ranging from developer, marketer and fund raiser. The most valuable part of my experience was building a strong community around our open source product. The community consisted of thousands of individuals and hundreds of contributors. I was on the front line of user feedback and translated their feedback into scalable product capabilities. This is evidence of my ability to work directly with designers and developers while shipping products which ultimate are used by consumers.
