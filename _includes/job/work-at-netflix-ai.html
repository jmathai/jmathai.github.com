  <p>Hello.</p>
  <p>
    I'm interested in the <em><a href="https://explore.jobs.netflix.net/careers/job/790298013968">Product Manager, AI Platform</a></em> role at <em>Netflix</em>.
    I created this page to convince both you and me that joining the Netflix team would be mutually beneficial.

  <h2>I'm Genuinely Interested</h2>
  <p>
    I've been a Netflix user since the DVD days and admire the company's attention to user experience.
    Whether it was waiting for the next DVD to arrive from the queue or today's version of finding something funny to watch - Netflix delivers :).
  </p>
  <p>
    I have a unique blend of AI experience ranging from my time at Google working directly with engineers training GCP's LLM and as a consumer of both OpenAI and Anthropic APIs to build prototypes and products.

  <h2>I Have Hands On Experience PMing AI Product Features</h2>
  <p>
    At Google, I led the integration of Gemini into our Serverless products (Cloud Run and Cloud Functions).
    I quickly learned the diligence and care required to expose GenAI features to customers.
    For example, I worked with the LLM model team to ensure that the models they were creating met our team's needs.
    I also idenfied many pain points that GenAI could help alleviate while exploring new capabilities never seen before.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here are some of the highlights of my work as GenAI PM Lead.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> I collected and organized hundreds of prompts and expected responses to use as a baseline measurement. This enabled us to iteratively test how well our team's prompt engineering efforts were working as well as the impact of using newer models.</li>
      <li><strong>Big and small bets:</strong> I created a framework to ensure a balance of obvious and aspirational features. Obvious features were low risk and low effort such as summarizations and alerts based off logs. Aspirational features inlcluded new experiences (see next).</li>
      <li><strong>New Experiences:</strong> I led a multi-modal experience which designs and deploys infrastructure. This was presented in a keynote at Google Cloud Next 2024.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>I'm Passionate About AI</h2>
  <p>
    I've spent the last year poking and prodding at the capabilities of LLMs.
  </p>
  <p>
    In that time, I launched several products.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Instagram Co-pilot for Interior Designers:</strong> I created a tool which Instagram-ready captions from a designer's portfolio.
    Users can specify the goal, tone and length of their post. <a href="https://post.withlattice.com">See it in action</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Create Apps with Prompts:</strong> I created a product similar to bolt.new, Replit Agent and Lovable which turns prompts into deployed applications.
    This was my foray into AI agents before the term existed.
    The application creation pipeline calls out to coding, testing, debugging and deployment agents to create a fully functional application.

    <strong>Meal Planning Butler:</strong> I created an app which lets users take any online recipe and automatically add the ingredients to their grocier's online cart for pickup or delivery.

  <h2>I Have Strong Product Sense</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Product Management, Google (7 years):</strong> I was a product manager and product lead at Google for 7 years. I started as an early member of the team which launched Cloud Identity and went on to lead the Cloud Functions product within the Serverless organization. Before leaving Google, I was the Gemini (GenAI) lead for Serverless where I got to launch several first of a kind experiences to users.

    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Founder, Trovebox (4 years):</strong> I co-founded Trovebox wearing many hats ranging from developer, marketer and fund raiser. The most valuable part of my experience was building a strong community around our open source product. The community consisted of thousands of individuals and hundreds of contributors. I was on the front line of user feedback and translated their feedback into scalable product capabilities. This is evidence of my ability to work directly with designers and developers while shipping products which are ultimately used by consumers.
