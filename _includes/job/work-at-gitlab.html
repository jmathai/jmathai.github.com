  I'm interested in the <em><a href="{{page.job_url}}">{{page.position}}</a></em> role at <em>{{page.company}}</em>.
  I created this page to convince both you and me that joining the {{page.company}} team would be mutually beneficial.

  <h2>I'm Genuinely Interested</h2>
  <p>
    As a software engineer turned product manager, I care about creating useful things to make developers more productive.
    Integrating AI into developer workflows is an area I have experience in.

  <h2>I Have Hands On Experience PMing AI Product Features</h2>
  <p>
    At Google, I led the integration of Gemini into our Serverless products (Cloud Run and Cloud Functions).
    I quickly learned the diligence and care required to expose GenAI features to customers.
    For example, I worked with the LLM model team to ensure that the models they were creating met our team's needs.
    I also idenfied many pain points that GenAI could help alleviate while exploring new capabilities never seen before.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here are some of the highlights of my work as GenAI PM Lead.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> I collected and organized hundreds of prompts and expected responses to use as a baseline measurement. This enabled us to iteratively test how well our team's prompt engineering efforts were working as well as the impact of using newer models.</li>
      <li><strong>Big and Small Bets:</strong> I created a framework to ensure a balance of obvious and aspirational features. Obvious features were low risk and low effort such as summarizations and alerts based off logs. Aspirational features inlcluded new experiences (see next).</li>
      <li><strong>New Experiences:</strong> I led a multi-modal experience which designs and deploys infrastructure. This was presented in a keynote at Google Cloud Next 2024.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>I'm Passionate About AI</h2>
  <p>
    I've spent the last year poking and prodding at the capabilities of LLMs.
  </p>
  <p>
    In that time, I launched several products.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Instagram Co-pilot for Interior Designers:</strong> I created a tool which Instagram-ready captions from a designer's portfolio.
    Users can specify the goal, tone and length of their post. <a href="https://post.withlattice.com">See it in action</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Create Apps with Prompts:</strong> I created a product similar to bolt.new, Replit Agent and Lovable which turns prompts into deployed applications.
    This was my foray into AI agents before the term existed.
    The application creation pipeline calls out to coding, testing, debugging and deployment agents to create a fully functional application.

  <p>
    <strong>Meal Planning Butler:</strong> I created an app which lets users take any online recipe and automatically add the ingredients to their grocier's online cart for pickup or delivery.

  <h2>I Understand the User</h2>
  <p>
    My experience as a software engineer gives me a deep understanding of opportunities for improvement.
    I've seen my own experience of writing, debugging and deploying code get supercharged by using AI tools.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm excited to think about how integrating AI into the editor experience can help developers focus their energy on the most important parts of their job.
