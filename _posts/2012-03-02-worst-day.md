It was around 4pm on a Friday and I found myself stuck in traffic on 101 northbound. I was by myself so I couldn't use the HOV lanes; not that they were any faster.

Let's rewind a bit. Patrick first emailed me on June 30<sup>th</sup> of 2011.

> I'm offering my help because I think your idea is great and it will be something special. -- Patrick, in his first email to me

I doubt he thought that email would result in him leaving his job and flying to the US just 9 months later. It was his first of many visits after he joined me as co-founder. Patrick was living in Belgium during the first two years of OpenPhoto. His visits became frequent and my kids adored him.

## Deep thoughts in traffic

Back to that traffic I was stuck in. March of 2012 was a particularly difficult time for our company. We were making great progress on our product and signing up more users every day but we were <a href="../fundraising/#failed">struggling to raise capital</a>. We didn't realize this when booking flights for Patrick to come out to California.

There were a lot of thoughts running through my head as I stared at cars with people who had normal jobs. People I imagined at the time to not have the type of financial and business stress I was feeling that day. I thought to myself, "Patrick used to be one of those people."

I wondered if I had ruined Patrick's life. I also knew that I needed to greet him with a smile and enthusiasm at SFO. 

It's one thing to have a bad day because I'm stressed about my own life. There was something extra terrible to think about how my actions might have inadvertantly affected someone else's.

## A great first visit

The stress subsided once I arrived at his terminal and picked him up. Being in the same room and working together was theraputic for us and we accomplished a ton in just one week. It helped to get on the same page and come up with a plan we both believed in moving forward.

Don't get me wrong. We had a lot of difficult conversations surrounding the business. But by the time he left a week later we felt confident in a plan to keep going.

OpenPhoto and Trovebox nearly died that week and I have Patrick to thank for its survival.
